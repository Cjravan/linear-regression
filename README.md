# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model for housing prices using linear regression and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing a dataset of housing features such as area, number of bedrooms, location, etc., we aim to develop a robust model that can provide accurate predictions of housing prices
# Model Development
The model is developed using linear regression, a widely used machine learning algorithm for predicting continuous variables. The code for model training and evaluation is available in the project name file. We have implemented data preprocessing steps, feature engineering techniques, and model training to optimize the performance of the model.
# Evaluation
To evaluate the performance of the model, we use various metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R-squared. These metrics provide insights into the accuracy and predictive power of our model.
